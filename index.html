Numerology refers to a physical waveform characteristics in terms of subcarrier spacing and corresponding time domain length. We can describe Numerology in a few different perspective as follows.
Subcarrier Spacing: In 5G NR, the subcarrier spacing can vary from 15 kHz to 960 kHz as of release 17. The larger subcarrier spacings allow for lower latency and support higher-frequency bands, while smaller spacings are suitable for lower-frequency bands and increased coverage.
Symbol Duration: The symbol duration in 5G NR is inversely proportional to the subcarrier spacing. A larger subcarrier spacing results in a shorter symbol duration, enabling faster data transmission and lower latency.
Scalable Numerology: The flexibility in 5G numerology allows for the system to adapt to different deployment scenarios, frequency bands, and use cases, ranging from low-bandwidth, wide-area coverage to high-bandwidth, low-latency applications.
5G numerology provides the foundation for the flexible and adaptive nature of 5G NR, enabling it to support a wide range of use cases and deployment scenarios
